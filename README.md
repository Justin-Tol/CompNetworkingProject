## About 

This is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network project that serves as an introduction to Computer Networking. The goal is to build a decentralized file-sharing system where peers at DSU can discover each other, establish direct connections, and efficiently transfer files.

We utilize TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable, connection-oriented peer communication. TCP ensures that data packets arrive in order and without errors, making it ideal for file transfers where data integrity is critical.

We implement core networking concepts such as:

- Socket programming for peer communication
- Peer discovery using a tracker-based approach
- Multi-threading for optimal data transmission
- File integrity verification with hashing and checksums
- Basic authentication for secure connections

This project helps us understand how distributed networks operate, the challenges of real-time communication, and the importance of data integrity in file transfers.
